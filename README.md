# Proxy-Rotation-API-fetcher

## Avoids the API call limit by changing the proxy each time.
## The program runs properly until all proxies hit the API call limit (~15 calls for each proxy).

## In order for program to work:
### In test.py file
###  1. Provide the list of proxies
###  2. Provide the list of urls to fetch
